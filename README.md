🏭 Industrial Copper Modeling
Predicting Selling Price and Status Using Machine Learning


📌 Project Overview
This project applies advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and predict two crucial metrics in the industrial copper manufacturing domain:
•	📈 Selling Price (Regression)
•	📊 Status of the Copper Sale (Classification)
By implementing Random Forest Regression and Extra Trees Classifier, this project provides actionable insights to assist in pricing strategy and status forecasting. The project also features an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time predictions based on user inputs.
